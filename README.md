# Learnify--Project
Learnify is a frontend-only educational website that I built as part of my college group project at CIEM, aimed at helping MAKAUT students easily access semester-wise notes and learning resources.  
The idea came from the struggle many students face in finding organized and reliable study materials.
Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I designed Learnify to be simple, responsive, and user-friendly, with features like department and semester selection, a real-time search bar, dark mode, and direct access to PDFs and video lecturesâ€”all without any backend. It's a small initiative to make learning a little easier for everyone.
